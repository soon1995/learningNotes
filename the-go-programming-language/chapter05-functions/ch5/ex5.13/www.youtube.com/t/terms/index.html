<h1 id="main"><b>Terms of Service</b></h1><p>Dated: January 5, 2022</p><h1><b>TERMS OF SERVICE</b></h1>
<h1 id="20c5cf0fa6"><b>Welcome to YouTube!</b></h1>
<p><b>Introduction<br></b>Thank you for using the YouTube platform and the products, services and features we make available to you as part of the platform (collectively, the “Service”).  </p>
<p><b>Our Service</b></p>
<p>The Service allows you to discover, watch and share videos and other content, provides a forum for people to connect, inform, and inspire others across the globe, and acts as a distribution platform for original content creators and advertisers large and small.

<p><b>Your Service Provider</b></p>
<p>The entity providing the Service is Google LLC, a company operating under the laws of Delaware, located at 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043 (referred to as “<b>YouTube</b>”, “<b>we</b>”, “<b>us</b>”, or “<b>our</b>”). References to YouTube’s “Affiliates” in these terms means the other companies within the Alphabet Inc. corporate group (now or in the future).</p>
<p><b>Applicable Terms<br></b>Your use of the Service is subject to these terms, the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/t/community_guidelines">YouTube Community Guidelines</a> and the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/t/policies">Policy, Safety and Copyright Policies</a> which may be updated from time to time (together, this "Agreement"). Your Agreement with us will also include the <a href="https://support.google.com/youtube/topic/30084?ref_topic=2972865">Advertising on YouTube Policies</a> if you provide advertising or sponsorships to the Service or incorporate paid promotions in your content. Any other links or references provided in these terms are for informational use only and are not part of the Agreement.</p>
<p>Please read this Agreement carefully and make sure you understand it. If you do not understand the Agreement, or do not accept any part of it, then you may not use the Service.</p>
<h1 id="eb887a967c"><b>Who may use the Service?</b></h1>

However, you do need a Google account to use some features. With a Google account, you may be able to like videos, subscribe to channels, create your own YouTube channel, and more. You can follow these instructions to <a href="https://accounts.google.com/signup/v2/webcreateaccount?flowName=GlifWebSignIn&amp;flowEntry=SignUp">create a Google account</a>.</p>

<ol class="decimal" start="1" style="list-style-type:decimal">
<li>access, reproduce, download, distribute, transmit, broadcast, display, sell, license, alter, modify or otherwise use any part of the Service or any Content except: (a) as expressly authorized by the Service; or (b) with prior written permission from YouTube and, if applicable, the respective rights holders;</li>
<li>circumvent, disable, fraudulently engage with, or otherwise interfere with any part of the Service (or attempt to do any of these things), including security-related features or features that (a) prevent or restrict the copying or other use of Content or (b) limit the use of the Service or Content;</li>

<li>use the Service to distribute unsolicited promotional or commercial content or other unwanted or mass solicitations;</li>

</ol>
<p><b>Reservation</b></p>
<p>Using the Service does not give you ownership of or rights to any aspect of the Service, including user names or any other Content posted by others or YouTube.</p>
<p><b>Develop, Improve and Update</b><b> the Service</b></p>
<p>YouTube is constantly changing and improving the Service. As part of this continual evolution, we may make modifications or changes (to all or part of the Service) such as adding or removing features and functionalities, offering new digital content or services or discontinuing old ones. We may also need to alter or discontinue the Service, or any part of it, in order to make performance or security improvements, make changes to comply with law, or prevent illegal activities on or abuse of our systems. These changes may affect all users, some users or even an individual user.  When the Service requires or includes downloadable software (such as the YouTube Studio application), that software may update automatically on your device once a new version or feature is available, subject to your device settings. If we make material changes that negatively impact your use of the Service, we’ll provide you with reasonable advance notice, except in urgent situations such as preventing abuse, responding to legal requirements, or addressing security and operability issues. We’ll also provide you with an opportunity to export your content from your Google Account using <a href="https://takeout.google.com/settings/takeout?pli=1">Google Takeout,</a> subject to applicable law and policies.  </p>
<h1 id="27dc3bf5d9"><b>Your Content and Conduct</b></h1>
<p><b>Uploading Content</b></p>
<p>If you have a YouTube channel, you may be able to upload Content to the Service. You may use your Content to promote your business or artistic enterprise. If you choose to upload Content, you must not submit to the Service any Content that does not comply with this Agreement (including the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/t/community_guidelines">YouTube Community Guidelines</a>) or the law. For example, the Content you submit must not include third-party intellectual property (such as copyrighted material) unless you have permission from that party or are otherwise legally entitled to do so. You are legally responsible for the Content you submit to the Service. We may use automated systems that analyze your Content to help detect infringement and abuse, such as spam, malware, and illegal content.</p>
<p><b>Rights you Grant</b></p>
<p>You retain ownership rights in your Content. However, we do require you to grant certain rights to YouTube and other users of the Service, as described below.</p>
<p><b>License to YouTube</b></p>
<p>By providing Content to the Service, you grant to YouTube a worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free, sublicensable and transferable license to use that Content (including to reproduce, distribute, prepare derivative works, display and perform it) in connection with the Service and YouTube’s (and its successors’ and Affiliates’) business, including for the purpose of promoting and redistributing part or all of the Service.</p>
<p><b>License to Other Users</b></p>
<p>You also grant each other user of the Service a worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free license to access your Content through the Service, and to use that Content, including to reproduce, distribute, prepare derivative works, display, and perform it, only as enabled by a feature of the Service (such as video playback or embeds). For clarity, this license does not grant any rights or permissions for a user to make use of your Content independent of the Service.</p>
<p><b>Duration of License</b></p>
<p>The licenses granted by you continue for a commercially reasonable period of time after you remove or delete your Content from the Service. You understand and agree, however, that YouTube may retain, but not display, distribute, or perform, server copies of your videos that have been removed or deleted.</p>
<p><b>Right to Monetize</b></p>
<p>You grant to YouTube the right to monetize your Content on the Service (and such monetization may include displaying ads on or within Content or charging users a fee for access). This Agreement does not entitle you to any payments. Starting June 1, 2021, any payments you may be entitled to receive from YouTube under any other agreement between you and YouTube (including for example payments under the YouTube Partner Program, Channel memberships or Super Chat) will be treated as royalties.  If required by law, Google will withhold taxes from such payments.</p>
<p><b>Removing Your Content</b></p>
<p>You may <a href="https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/55770">remove your Content</a> from the Service at any time. You also have the option to <a href="https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/56100">make a copy of your Content</a> before removing it. You must remove your Content if you no longer have the rights required by these terms.</p>
<p><b>Removal of Content By YouTube</b></p>
<p>If we reasonably believe that any of your Content (1) is in breach of this Agreement or (2) may cause harm to YouTube, our users, or third parties, we reserve the right to remove or take down that Content in our discretion. We will notify you with the reason for our action unless we reasonably believe that to do so: (a) would breach the law or the direction of a legal enforcement authority or would otherwise risk legal liability for YouTube or our Affiliates; (b) would compromise an investigation or the integrity or operation of the Service; or (c) would cause harm to any user, other third party, YouTube or our Affiliates. You can learn more about reporting and enforcement, including how to appeal on the <a href="https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/6395024">Troubleshooting</a> page of our Help Center.</p>
<h1><b>Community Guidelines Strikes</b></h1>
<p>YouTube operates a system of “strikes” in respect of Content that violates the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/t/community_guidelines">YouTube Community Guidelines</a>. Each strike comes with varying restrictions and may result in the permanent removal of your channel from YouTube.  A full description of how a strike affects your channel is available on the <a href="https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2802032">Community Guidelines Strikes Basics</a> page. If you believe that a strike has been issued in error, you may <a href="https://studio.youtube.com/">appeal here</a>.</p>
<p>If your channel has been restricted due to a strike, you must not use another channel to circumvent these restrictions. Violation of this prohibition is a material breach of this Agreement and Google reserves the right to terminate your Google account or your access to all or part of the Service.</p>
<p><b>Copyright Protection</b></p>
<p>We provide information to help copyright holders manage their intellectual property online in our <a href="https://www.youtube.com/t/copyright_center">YouTube Copyright Center</a>. If you believe your copyright has been infringed on the Service, please <a href="https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2807622">send us a notice</a>.</p>
<p>We respond to notices of alleged copyright infringement according to the process in our <a href="https://www.youtube.com/t/copyright_center">YouTube Copyright Center</a>, where you can also find information about how to resolve a copyright strike. YouTube's policies provide for the termination, in appropriate circumstances, of repeat infringers’ access to the Service.</p>
<h1 id="8d13a409a3"><b>Account Suspension &amp; Termination</b></h1>
<p><b>Terminations by You<br></b>You may stop using the Service at any time. Follow these <a href="https://myaccount.google.com/delete-services-or-account">instructions</a> to delete the Service from your Google Account, which involves closing your YouTube channel and removing your data. You also have the option to download a copy of your data first.</p>
<p><b>Terminations and Suspensions by YouTube</b></p>
<p>YouTube reserves the right to suspend or terminate your Google account or your access to all or part of the Service if (a) you materially or repeatedly breach this Agreement; (b) we are required to do so to comply with a legal requirement or a court order; or (c) we believe there has been conduct that creates (or could create) liability or harm to any user, other third party, YouTube or our Affiliates.<br></p>
<p><b>Notice for Termination or Suspension</b></p>
<p>We will notify you with the reason for termination or suspension by YouTube unless we reasonably believe that to do so: (a) would violate the law or the direction of a legal enforcement authority; (b) would compromise an investigation; (c) would compromise the integrity, operation or security of the Service; or (d) would cause harm to any user, other third party, YouTube or our Affiliates.</p>
<p><b>Effect of Account Suspension or Termination</b></p>
<p>If your Google account is terminated or your access to the Service is restricted, you may continue using certain aspects of the Service (such as viewing only) without an account, and this Agreement will continue to apply to such use. If you believe your that the termination or suspension has been made in error, you can <a href="https://support.google.com/accounts/contact/suspended?p=youtube">appeal using this form</a>.</p>
<h1 id="8c38269fae"><b>About Software in the Service</b></h1>
<p><b>Downloadable Software<br></b>When the Service requires or includes downloadable software (such as the YouTube Studio application), unless that software is governed by additional terms which provide a license, YouTube gives you a personal, worldwide, royalty-free, non-assignable and non-exclusive license to use the software provided to you by YouTube as part of the Service. This license is for the sole purpose of enabling you to use and enjoy the benefit of the Service as provided by YouTube, in the manner permitted by this Agreement. You are not allowed to copy, modify, distribute, sell, or lease any part of the software, or to reverse-engineer or attempt to extract the source code of that software, unless laws prohibit these restrictions or you have YouTube’s written permission.</p>
<p><b>Open Source<br></b>Some software used in our Service may be offered under an open source license that we make available to you. There may be provisions in an open source license that expressly override some of these terms, so please be sure to read those licenses.  </p>
<h1 id="56eee99974"><b>Other Legal Terms</b></h1>

If it turns out that a particular term of this Agreement is not enforceable for any reason, this will not affect any other terms.</p>
<p><b>No Waiver<br></b>If you fail to comply with this Agreement and we do not take immediate action, this does not mean that we are giving up any rights that we may have (such as the right to take action in the future).</p>

<p>In these terms, “include” or “including” means “including but not limited to,” and any examples we give are for illustrative purposes.</p>
